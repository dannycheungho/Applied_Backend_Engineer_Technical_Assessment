## Choice of Framework & Library
I choose Flask framework on this assessment.

Benefits:
* Flask is simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. 
* Flask is a lightweight and modular framework that allows us to build scalable and maintainable web applications quickly.
* Flask is easy to learn and has a shallow learning curve, which means that developers can quickly start developing applications without spending too much time on configuration and setup.
* Flask has a smaller, more focused community compared to Django, which can be helpful for getting answers to specific questions related to tihs application.

### Potential Improvement
If I had more time, I would modularize the entire project and extend each component using functional programming techniques. Additionally, I would transfer the contents of the Controller layer to the Service layer, as the current approach is not considered a best practice. Finally, I would focus on writing more comprehensive error handling.

## Production Consideration
When deploying the application to a production environment, we need to take the following extra steps to ensure that the application is secure and reliable:

* Ensure the App Works in a Staging Environment
* Unit tests / Untegration tests should be conducted before each deployment.
* Ensure the ability to perform a rollback in case of a failed deployment.
* Be ready to implement a comprehensive logging system.
* Simulate a deployment in the production environment of dev/UAT on each feature brand

### Assumptions
a. Assumptions made when designing the data model and API schema:

    The Doctor entity has a unique email and phone number.
    The District entity has a unique clinic_phone number.
    Each Doctor can have multiple Districts and Categories associated with them.
    The Category entity has a unique category_name.

b. Other assumptions and opinions taken throughout the assessments:

    The use of Enum for the district and category name provides a clear and consistent definition for the categories and districts.
    The use of backref and relationship to connect the entities in the database simplifies the process of querying data.
    The use of lazy=True allows for more efficient queries by not loading related data until it is explicitly accessed.
